# weatherDiagrams

A server that analyzes data which it gets from several stations (probably Raspberry Pi's) and
creates diagrams. I think this is a cool project idea because it requires a lot of different
skillsets like Hardware, Web Dev and Data Analyzation. For the stations I am using Python
because it's pretty easy to work with hardware on a RPi with Python; for the Api the stations
use I am using Nodejs, just because I know it the best. And for the Data Analyzation I am
using Python because there are so many usful libraries and I do not know any other good
programming languages for this stuff very well.
